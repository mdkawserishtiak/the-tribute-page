                <strong>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</strong> was a Bangladeshi politician and statesman who played a pivotal
                role in the
                independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971. He was the leader of the Awami League and fought for
                greater autonomy and eventual independence for East Pakistan. Despite winning a majority in the Pakistan
                National Assembly in 1970, he was arrested by the Pakistani military and held in solitary confinement,
                which sparked massive protests in East Pakistan. Following the creation of Bangladesh, he became the
                country's first Prime Minister but was assassinated in a military coup in 1975. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is
                widely revered as the Father of the Nation in Bangladesh for his unwavering commitment to the cause of
                independence and his efforts to build a democratic and prosperous nation.
